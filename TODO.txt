alart TODO
==========

(I don't know when these items will get done.)

* Implement a more lazy evaluation, so that a graphics output that ultimately
  isn't used doesn't spend time generating graphics.
* Implement support for simple animation
* Refactor alart so that it takes a modularized approach to graphics
  generation, i.e. it allows mor different kinds of graphical patterns to be
  generated by the same alart core. Move the current single graphics generator
  to its own file.
* Implement a new graphics generator for generation of images with polygons in
  different shapes and colors, overlapping parts of each other. Good for the
  new animation ability
* Implement another new generator for generation of images with slightly
  distorted circles in different sizes and colors, positioned here and there.
